# Wheels on Fire 🚗🔥

Hey there, I'm **John O'Reilly**, the proud owner of **Wheels on Fire**.  

I've been in the car business for as long as I can remember, and nothing excites me more than a well-tuned engine. I’ll admit — I’m a bit of a perfectionist (especially when it comes to cars… people, not so much).  

This project is all about creating a website that:  
- Showcases my personal car collection 🏎️  
- Helps people find their perfect car 🚘  
- Adds a sprinkle of my dry humour along the way 😏

## About the Project
The website will feature:  
- **Car Showcase** – A gallery of classic and modern cars.  
- **Car Finder** – Helping visitors browse and filter to find the right fit.  
- **AI** – To give more insights to the vehicle.  
- **Personal Touch** – Insights, stories, and a hint of humour from yours truly.

## Goals
- Build an engaging and user-friendly car showcase website.  
- Share my passion for engines, design, and everything on four wheels.  
- Connect with fellow car enthusiasts who appreciate detail and personality.
